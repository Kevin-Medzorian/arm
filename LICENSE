O’ Procrastination, thy distract my concentration,
My mind wandering farther from the conversation,
Irrelevant websites I traverse and immerse,
As productivity I have only dispersed,
My team my friends I have betrayed,
Losing them, for responsibility I had not paid,
Thou hath drowned me in an infinite ocean,
As waters obfuscate and submerge my devotion,
The clock’s hands aimlessly spin acceleratingly faster,
As the hourglass sands flowing aimlessly is all I can master,
O Procrastination spare me from thy deceiving hands,
And extricate me from thy hourglass of draining sands,
O Procrastination I beseech thee to set me free,
For a failure and a burdening teammate I shall not be!
